# Schema Builder for Graph Data Store

This repo holds an implementation of a `schema` module that will look to transform an input of vertex definitions into a suitable schema definition that can then be sent to a Graph Data Store instance through its REST API.

Currently, this repo is in active development as we seek to cover a solid number of schema building use cases.
